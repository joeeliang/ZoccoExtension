# Chrome Extension: Bold First Letters
## Description

Bold First Letters is a Chrome browser extension that enhances the visual appearance of websites by automatically making the first few letters of each paragraph element bold. It's a simple yet effective way to draw attention to the beginning of paragraphs, making them more noticeable and engaging for readers.

Please note that the extension specifically targets paragraph elements, so it won't affect any other types of HTML elements on the page.

## Installation

To install the extension, follow these steps:

1. Download the extension files from the GitHub repository or the provided link.
2. Open Google Chrome and navigate to the `chrome://extensions` URL.
3. Enable the "Developer mode" toggle in the top right corner.
4. Click on the "Load unpacked" button and select the folder containing the extension files.
5. The Bold First Letters extension will now be installed and ready to use.

## How to Use

Once the extension is installed, simply navigate to any website with paragraph content. The extension will automatically detect and modify the first few letters of each paragraph to be bold.
Change the slider value.
Click confirm when done.
The value of the slider will be how many letters bolded per word.

Please keep in mind that this extension only works on websites that use standard HTML paragraph elements (`<p>`). It won't apply the bolding effect to other HTML elements, such as headings or lists.
